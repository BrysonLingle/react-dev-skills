# React Dev Skills Lab - Part 3

## Intro

This lab will simply ask you to use the `useState` hook to add state to the React Dev Skills app.

Open your "react-dev-skills" and follow the instructions below. Make sure you commit - `"part 2 dev skills complete"` before begining part 3.

Updating that state will be an exercise in part 4.

## Exercises

1. Make sure you stage and commit - `"part 1 dev skills complete"` before begining part 2.

2. Use the `useState` hook to add a state value named `skills`.

3. Be sure to name the setter function according to the convention discussed in the lesson.

4. Initialize the state using the same array of skill objects used in part 2.

5. When finished, the skills should continue to be displayed without error:
